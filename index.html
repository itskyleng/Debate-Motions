        <p>Earth was destroyed long before you were born. Shortly before the end, 
            humanity pooled its last resources to send out a ship with a small group of 
            survivors selected to eventually repopulate humanity on a faraway habitable planet, 
            leaving the rest of humanity to die. Because the journey is so long, it will take 
            multiple generations, and only the distant descendants of the original group will 
            ever see their new home. You belong to a middle generation - you were born and will 
            die in transit, and so will your children and grandchildren. Your whole life has been 
            devoted to the maintenance of the ship, which has a small population.

        <p>You are in a happy, committed ten-year long relationship with your significant other (with a house and a dog). You recently found out that early on into the relationship, your partner cheated on you with another person, and you have not told anyone. Your significant other is the only other person that knows about the infidelity, and does not know that you know. You have in your hands a pill to make you instantly forget this information, but it will only work on this day.

        <p>" 'That girl' is a vaguely wellness-y archetype that's risen in popularity on TikTok since April 2021 "That girl' gets up early, makes her bed, works out, and eats a bowl of fruit all before you've even woken up. She fills out gratitude journals, reads every day and studies hard. She's essentially a walking Pinterest board. In other words, she is a female influencer who shows her daily routines, highlighting a lifestyle that is healthy, highly productive, and focused on mental well-being."

        <p>Earth was destroyed long before you were born. Shortly before the end, 
            humanity pooled its last resources to send out a ship with a small group of 
            survivors selected to eventually repopulate humanity on a faraway habitable planet, 
            leaving the rest of humanity to die. Because the journey is so long, it will take 
            multiple generations, and only the distant descendants of the original group will 
            ever see their new home. You belong to a middle generation - you were born and will 
            die in transit, and so will your children and grandchildren. Your whole life has been 
            devoted to the maintenance of the ship, which has a small population.

        <p>Planet X is several hundred years ahead of Earth in terms of technological development and has recently achieved the capacity for widespread and commercially accessible intergalactic travel. Their increased activity in space and in neighbouring systems has attracted the attention of the galactic empire; a civilisation whose brutal invasions and subjugations have led to an empire spanning many galaxies. The galactic empire has its central government many light years from Planet X and Planet X lies several systems beyond the edge of the empire's previous territories. The galactic empire has successfully invaded Planet X and deposed its governing bodies, though its grip on the planet is not yet absolute. The empire has begun to enslave inhabitants of Planet X to work in resource extraction roles to fuel further conquest.

        <p>Kimberly Noel Kardashian is an American media personality, socialite, model, and businesswoman. She first gained media attention as a friend and stylist of Paris Hilton, but received wider notice after the sex tape shot with her then-boyfriend Ray J was released in 2007. Later that year, she and her family began to appear in the E! reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians (2007–2021). Kardashian developed a significant presence online and across numerous social media platforms, including hundreds of millions of followers on Twitter and Instagram. She has released a variety of products tied to her name, including the 2014 mobile game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, a variety of clothing and products, the 2015 photo book Selfish and her eponymous personal app. Her relationship with rapper Kanye West has also received significant media coverage; they married in 2014 and have four children together. In recent years, Kardashian has focused on her own businesses by founding KKW Beauty and KKW Fragrance in 2017. In 2019, she launched shapewear company Skims, which was previously called ""Kimono"" but changed its name following widespread backlash. Kardashian has also become more politically active by lobbying president Donald Trump for prison reform and lobbying for Alice Marie Johnson to be granted clemency. She has advocated for the recognition of the Armenian genocide on numerous occasions. Kardashian is also planning to become a lawyer by doing a four-year law apprenticeship that is supervised by the legal nonprofit #cut50, which was co-founded by Van Jones

        <p>Between 2013 and 2017, Anna Sorokin (under the name Anna Delvey) scammed a number of elite people and institutions into footing the bill for her lavish Manhattan lifestyle, which included a deluxe suite at the Soho hotel 11 Howard. She did this primarily by posing as a wealthy German heiress and aspiring entrepreneur — she told investors she was planning to launch ""a Soho House-ish type club"" that would also be an art space. Sorokin used Microsoft Word to create fake bank statements and other financial documents purporting to show that she had €60 million in Swiss bank accounts but could not access them since they were in trust and she was in the U.S. She survived off of bounced checks and fake wire transfers. She organized parties, where she invited people she ""barely knew... as if it was maybe the second time they'd ever met."" Sorokin relied on her and other acquaintances to pay for her expenses by claiming she had forgotten her wallet or that it was an emergency and her credit cards did not work. These expenses ranged from drinks at a bar to hotel stays and flights totaling tens of thousands of dollars. In 2017, she was arrested after defrauding or intentionally deceiving major financial institutions, banks, hotels, and acquaintances in the United States for a total of $275,000, and was sentenced to 4 to 12 years in prison

        <h3>Infoslide</h3>
        <p>Earth was destroyed long before you were born. Shortly before the end, 
            humanity pooled its last resources to send out a ship with a small group of 
            survivors selected to eventually repopulate humanity on a faraway habitable planet, 
            leaving the rest of humanity to die. Because the journey is so long, it will take 
            multiple generations, and only the distant descendants of the original group will 
            ever see their new home. You belong to a middle generation - you were born and will 
            die in transit, and so will your children and grandchildren. Your whole life has been 
            devoted to the maintenance of the ship, which has a small population.

        <h3>Infoslide</h3>
        <p>You are a young adult with no children. You, your parent and your life partner are walking along a dangerous river when your parent and your partner both fall in. Neither of them can swim, and you only have the time and strength to save one.
        </p>
        <h3>Motion</h3> 
        <p>THW save your partner</p>

        <h3>Infoslide</h3> 
        <p>You are in a happy, committed ten-year long relationship with your significant other (with a house and a dog). You recently found out that early on into the relationship, your partner cheated on you with another person, and you have not told anyone. Your significant other is the only other person that knows about the infidelity, and does not know that you know. You have in your hands a pill to make you instantly forget this information, but it will only work on this day.
        </p>
        <h3>Motion</h3>
        <p>TH as this person at this point in time with the pill in their hands would take the pill
        </p>

        <hr class = "solid">

        <h3>Infoslide</h3> 
        <p>There is a pill that if taken will make it so you never feel extreme emotions again (extreme anger, lots of love etc)
        </p>
        <h3>Motion</h3>
        <p>TH as a person in their early 20s would take the pill

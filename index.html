        <p>Earth was destroyed long before you were born. Shortly before the end, 
            humanity pooled its last resources to send out a ship with a small group of 
            survivors selected to eventually repopulate humanity on a faraway habitable planet, 
            leaving the rest of humanity to die. Because the journey is so long, it will take 
            multiple generations, and only the distant descendants of the original group will 
            ever see their new home. You belong to a middle generation - you were born and will 
            die in transit, and so will your children and grandchildren. Your whole life has been 
            devoted to the maintenance of the ship, which has a small population.
